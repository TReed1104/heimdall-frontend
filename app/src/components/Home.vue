        <p>Welcome to Heimdall, the lab monitoring service. Heimdall is an open-source project designed and developed by the School of Computer Science Technical team at the University of Lincoln.<br/><br/>
        The purpose of the project was to provide a cloud based REST API to provide remote monitoring to the team, allowing them to ensure their facilities were in a fully working order.
        This is achieved by recording a collection of system data about each machine registered with the system, which is then interpretted and fed to the team to notify them remotely of any changes or issues.<br/><br/>
        During the intial iteration of the system, it was identified that the recorded data could also be used to provide a "Find-a-PC" application to our students, allowing them to always be able to see where PCs are available for use in our computing labs.</p>
